## Coding:Challenge()

This is a simple quiz tool to help any learning developer memorize common javascript terms and definitions.

Coding:Challenge() is easily updated and can even be reused for any kind of questions. Simply update the quiz array (var codingQuiz) with another array and the program will automatically update the questions and the time available based on the length of the array.

## How it works

Questions are picked at randam and are not repeated. This ensures that everytime you play the game, its a little different.
The length of the array also automatically adjusts the length of time available on the countdown clock.

If the game is too easy, change the variable in the timer function to set less time and make the game a little bit harder.:)
